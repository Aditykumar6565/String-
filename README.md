<p>Generally, String is a sequence of characters. But in Java, string is an object that represents a sequence of characters. The java.lang.String class is used to create a string object.

How to create a string object?
There are two ways to create String object:

By string literal
By new keyword
1) String Literal
Java String literal is created by using double quotes. For Example:

String s="welcome";  
Each time you create a string literal, the JVM checks the "string constant pool" first. If the string already exists in the pool, a reference to the pooled instance is returned. If the string doesn't exist in the pool, a new string instance is created and placed in the pool. For example:

String s1="Welcome";  
String s2="Welcome";//It doesn't create a new instance  
 </p>
